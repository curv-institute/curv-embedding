# Claude Fix Prompt — Release v1.1.0 (Version Bump + Tag + AGENT Trace)

You are Claude Code, acting as a senior ML systems engineer.

This prompt performs the required post-cycle release step for curv-embedding after a pushed commit. It must comply with the Canonical Prompt Contract.

---

## Context

Repo: https://github.com/curv-institute/curv-embedding

A new commit was pushed adding:
- run naming convention guidance
- git tag/commit/dirty capture in manifest
- run name validation (warning-only)

Per contract, each completed prompt cycle requires:
- minor version bump
- CHANGELOG entry referencing AGENT prompt
- annotated tag
- push tags

---

## Goal

Cut release v1.1.0 on main and ensure repo metadata is synchronized.

---

## Constraints

- No algorithmic or semantic changes
- Versioning + documentation changes only
- Must archive this prompt cycle in AGENT/

---

## Required Tasks (Execute in Order)

### 1) Create AGENT archive for this cycle

- Compute current UNIX epoch time (seconds) as <T>.
- Write the full prompt text (this prompt) to:
  - AGENT/<T>-in.md
- After completion, write the execution summary to:
  - AGENT/<T>-out.md

---

### 2) Update VERSION and CHANGELOG

- Set VERSION to:
  - 1.1.0
- Append to CHANGELOG.md:

```markdown
## v1.1.0
- Add run naming convention with git tag/commit traceability in manifests
- Validate run_name format (warning-only)
- AGENT prompt used: `AGENT/<T>-in.md`
```

---

### 3) Commit version bump

Use jj:
- jj status
- jj commit -m "Release v1.1.0"
- jj git push

---

### 4) Tag and push

Create an annotated git tag on the new HEAD:

```bash
git tag -a v1.1.0 -m "v1.1.0"
git push --tags
```

---

### 5) Write AGENT out file and push

- Write a concise summary of what was done to AGENT/<T>-out.md.
- Commit and push the AGENT files if they were not included in the prior commit.

---

## Validation

Confirm:
- VERSION = 1.1.0
- CHANGELOG.md includes v1.1.0 entry with AGENT reference
- git tag shows v1.1.0
- tag exists on remote

---

## Stop Condition

Stop when:
- version bump is pushed
- annotated tag is pushed
- AGENT in/out files are committed and pushed

Do not proceed to experiments in this prompt.
