# Execution Output — Push, Tag v1.0.0, and Formalize Baseline

**Timestamp**: 2026-01-16
**Run ID**: 1768590839

## Summary

Successfully brought the curv-embedding repository into full compliance with the Canonical Prompt Contract and established an immutable v1.0.0 baseline.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Created and Pushed Canonical Repository

- Created `curv-institute/curv-embedding` on GitHub
- Pushed all existing commits:
  - `8a39c31` Initialize repository structure
  - `53549f7` Implement stability-driven chunking for vector database embeddings
  - `53a124e` Archive implementation output to AGENT/
  - `e4765d0` Release v1.0.0: Formalize baseline with explicit diagnostic mode

### 2. Explicit Diagnostic Mode Labeling

Added `[diagnostics]` section to `configs/default.toml`:
```toml
[diagnostics]
mode = "proxy_entropy"
description = "v1.0.0 baseline uses proxy diagnostics: K=byte_entropy, S=inverse_variance, B=newlines"
```

Added `DiagnosticsConfig` dataclass to `src/config.py`:
- Included in `Config` class
- Serialized to manifests via `to_dict()`
- Mode explicitly labels that v1.0.0 uses proxy signals, not full HHC/LIL

### 3. Tagged Repository as v1.0.0

Version files updated:
- `VERSION` → `1.0.0`
- `CITATION.cff` → `version: 1.0.0`
- `src/__init__.py` → `__version__ = "1.0.0"`

CHANGELOG entry added with full feature list and technical notes.

Created annotated tag:
```
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "v1.0.0 - Initial stability-driven chunking baseline"
git push --tags
```

### 4. Archived Prompt Cycle

- Input: `AGENT/1768590839-in.md`
- Output: `AGENT/1768590839-out.md`
